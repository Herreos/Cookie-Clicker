# Cookie-Clicker - Differences between base application and mine

Base game, created by Orteil and Opti, is launched on the browser, I created desktop application in C# language. My application don't have as much options as the original game and is less complex. I developed also simplier design of user interface and other color scheme in the game.

# Cookie-Clicker - Game rules

This game is about collecting cookies. You can do it by clicking on cookie, by buying buildings and its upgrades. Each building has information about purchase price, quantity of already bought buildings and how much profit the buildings give to the player. Upgrades appear for 5, 15, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 bought buildings and increase buildings production twice.

Have fun! :)
